# CNN-catsVSdogs-

The goal of this project is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can classify images of cats and dogs. This is a classical deep learning project that introduces concepts of convolution, pooling, activation functions, and transfer learning.

# Dataset Information

The training archive contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats. Train your algorithm on these files and predict the labels

(1 = dog, 0 = cat)
